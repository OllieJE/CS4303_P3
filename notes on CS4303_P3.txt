notes on CS4303_P3


no need to only update overlapping tiles like in the roguelike game as:
	- differently shaped entities make it hard (e.g. spinning obstacle)
	- not as many tiles



Obstacles:
- Spinny thing ("o" for orbit)
- Spikes ("s" for spikes)



entity data 
entities have a tile position and other important shit, for example for the player only position is needed
but for orbiting shit the length, direction and speed are required

Player:
"p",pos_x,pos_y

Orbit:


Spike:
"s",pos_x,pos_y,time_alive,time_delay
	- time_alive is the time the spike stays up for
	- time_delay is the time the spike stays down for


Circular saw thiings (think PoE labyrinths)
"c",pos_x,pos_y,end_pos_x,end_pos_y,size,speed
