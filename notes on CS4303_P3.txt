notes on CS4303_P3


no need to only update overlapping tiles like in the roguelike game as:
	- differently shaped entities make it hard (e.g. spinning obstacle)
	- not as many tiles



Obstacles:
- Spinny thing ("o" for orbit)
- Spikes ("s" for spikes)



entity data 
entities have a tile position and other important shit, for example for the player only position is needed
but for orbiting shit the length, direction and speed are required

Player:
"p", pos_x, pos_y

Orbiter:
"o", pos_x, pos_y, radius, start_direction, width, speed, centred
	- start_direction is given in degrees, then converted to radians
	- radius is given in tiles; e.g. a radius of 4 would have the orbiter cover four tiles lengths'
	- speed is the time taken to make one full rotation
	- centred refers to if the orbiter is in the middle of a tile or in the intersection between four tiles


Spike:
"s", pos_x, pos_y, time_alive, time_delay
	- time_alive is the time the spike stays up for in seconds
	- time_delay is the time the spike stays down for in seconds


Circular saw things (think PoE labyrinths)
"c", pos_x, pos_y, end_pos_x, end_pos_y, size,speed



EXTRA SHIT:
- slowly rotate the whole map lul
