notes on CS4303_P3


tilemap keys:
1: regular, low-friction surface
2: high-friction surface


no need to only update overlapping tiles like in the roguelike game as:
	- differently shaped entities make it hard (e.g. spinning obstacle)
	- not as many tiles



Obstacles:
- Spinny thing ("o" for orbit)
- Spikes ("s" for spikes)



entity data 
entities have a tile position and other important shit, for example for the player only position is needed
but for orbiting shit the length, direction and speed are required

Player:
"p", pos_x, pos_y

Orbiter:
"o", pos_x, pos_y, radius, start_direction, width, speed, centred
	- start_direction is given in degrees, then converted to radians
	- radius is given in tiles; e.g. a radius of 4 would have the orbiter cover four tiles lengths'
	- speed is the time taken to make one full rotation
	- centred refers to if the orbiter is in the middle of a tile or in the intersection between four tiles


Spike:
"s", pos_x, pos_y, time_alive, time_delay
	- time_alive is the time the spike stays up for in seconds
	- time_delay is the time the spike stays down for in seconds


Circular saw things (think PoE labyrinths)
"c", pos_x, pos_y, end_pos_x, end_pos_y, size, speed, delay, centred
	- delay is the time the saw stops at each end in seconds
	- speed is given in tiles/second


Jump-pad
"j", pos_x, pos_y


Collider
"C", pos_x, pos_y, size, centred


EXTRA SHIT:
- slowly rotate the whole map lul


rotating the player is difficult because obviously they need to rotate the smallest amount right
but because the shit is lke this:
 
        0
        ^
1.5 PI<- -> HALF_PI
        "
       PI

 we can't just check if the target orientation is bigger or smaller
so we see if it is bigger by at least PI, if it is then rotate the other way




OTHER SHIT BESIDES OBSTAcLES TO ADD:
- BOSS FIGHT
- HELL YEAH THAT'S IT BUT IUTS GONNA BE SICK
- ALSO MUSIC AND SOUND EFFECTS


boss fight:
- circular attack with gaps (think gorgun's attacks)
- reach certain tiles in time


abilities:
- dash in facing direction
-
